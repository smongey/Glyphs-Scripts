# Glyphs Scripts

### Letters of Credit – Metrics Script

Apply metrics keys to the currently selected font based on the guidelines [here](https://briem.net/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.03.capitals.htm) that reference Walter Tracy’s Letters of Credit. You will need to have designed and spaced the following:

-   n
-   o
-   v
-   H
-   O
-   V

The script will highlight these glyphs in grey and highlight other glyphs in dark blue that will need to be spaced manually between nn and oo.
