# Glyphs Scripts

### Letters of Credit – Metrics Script

Apply metrics keys to the currently selected font based on the guidelines [here](https://briem.net/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.03.capitals.htm) that reference the approach outlined in Walter Tracy’s Letters of Credit. You will need to have designed and spaced the following:

-   n
-   o
-   v
-   H
-   O
-   V

The script will highlight these required glyphs in grey and highlight glyphs that need to be manually spaced between n’s and o’s in blue.
