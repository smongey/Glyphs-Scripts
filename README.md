# Glyphs Scripts

### Letters of Credit – Metrics Script

Apply metrics keys to the currently selected font based on the spacing guidelines outlined [here](https://briem.net/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.03.capitals.htm) and [here](https://briem.net/2/2.3.5a/2.3.5.04.lower.case.htm). This references the approach outlined in Walter Tracy’s Letters of Credit. You will need to have designed and spaced the following to get any use out of this:

-   n
-   o
-   v
-   H
-   O
-   V

The script will highlight these required glyphs in grey and highlight glyphs that need to be manually spaced between n’s and o’s in blue. The rest it will add appropriate Metrics Keys that can act as a sensible default when roughing out the first draft of your letters. You may want to manually tweak the values where metric math is happening. For example on briem is says "we’ll assume that 'slightly' means five or ten per cent.". These things are hardcoed at the minute and probably what I’ll try to add next.

-   some ui
-   control what factor 5%, 10%, etc for certain glyphs
-   apply spacing sample text to a new tab and highlight it

Remember this is a quick and easily applied starting point but a starting point is all it is.
